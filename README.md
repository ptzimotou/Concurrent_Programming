Description
-------
Concurrent_Programming is a project created for the purpose of our undergraduate course Concurrent Programming.

This project aims to solve and implement various synchronization problems over a few problems described below.


Folders 
-------
p_1: 
	- p_1_1: Format as process flow over 3 threads.
	- p_1_2: Parallel fractal computation using active standby technique.

p_2: (Using mutexes)
	- p_2_1: Parallel fractal computation without using active standby technique.
	- p_2_2: Small bridge (Flow control over a small bridge)
	- p_3_3: Train

p_3: (Using monitors)
	- p_3_1: Small bridge (Flow control over a small bridge)
	- p_3_2: Train
	- p_3_3: Implement a synchronization frame based on the spirit of a controller (monitors)

p_4:
	- p_4_1: Create an environment for simultaneous execution (virtual)
	- p_4_2: Create an environment for simultaneous execution (actual)
